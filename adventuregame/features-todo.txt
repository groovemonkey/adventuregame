In no particular order:


-locations -- add a "save" method that writes the current state of the location
-abstract the editing functions out of the adventuregame Location class code (just open and edit the classes in
	the editor code)


-player input handling
-main screen
-ability to save and load games



DONE:
-split game files!! locations and choices in a separate file.
