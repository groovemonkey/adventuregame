In no particular order:

-thenet -- full testing; get it working properly
-put existing locations from /code/adventuregame into the location file --
		(read the old location class, read in the file, and port it over into new location-class objects.  save normally.)

-port content from old adventuregame

-locations -- add a "save" method that writes the current state of the location
-abstract the editing functions out of the adventuregame Location class code (just open and edit the classes in
	the editor code)


-player input handling (use code from old adventuregame)
-main screen
-ability to save and load games



DONE:
-split game files!! locations in a separate file.
-added thenet as a separate location, special input handling for "choose" function to differentiate between
a regular location and "thenet"
