In no particular order:

-locations -- add a "save" method that writes the current state of the location
-abstract the editing functions out of the adventuregame Location class code (just open and edit the classes in
	the editor code)

-main screen
-ability to save and load games
-port content from old adventuregame (strip all useful code out)

#############################
DONE:
-split game files!! locations in a separate file.
-added thenet as a separate location, special input handling for "choose" function to differentiate between
a regular location and "thenet"
-put existing locations from /code/adventuregame into the location file
-implemented a "commands to run" proc/block for choices.  Each choice has a proc (empty if no action is needed for that choice),
	and the blocks are run automatically from the Choice.choose() function.
-player input handling (used code from old adventuregame)
-help menu added
-thenet -- full testing; got it working properly
