In no particular order:

-implement a "commands to run" proc/block for choices.  Each choice has either a "pass" or some code in its block,
	and the blocks are run automatically from the makechoice function.

-thenet -- full testing; get it working properly
		--mail broken
		--research broken
		--news FIXED

-locations -- add a "save" method that writes the current state of the location
-abstract the editing functions out of the adventuregame Location class code (just open and edit the classes in
	the editor code)


-player input handling (use code from old adventuregame)
-main screen
-ability to save and load games
-port content from old adventuregame (strip all useful code out)


DONE:
-split game files!! locations in a separate file.
-added thenet as a separate location, special input handling for "choose" function to differentiate between
a regular location and "thenet"
-put existing locations from /code/adventuregame into the location file
