TODO:

-numbered list of locations -- number selects the correct location (range between 0..Locations.len()?)		
-delete what's in the location file before writing to it (make backup first?)
-complete deletion of a location and all choice-references to it.


DONE
-location selection list (scan file)
-to make a location-exit come out where you already are (no location change), leave it blank ("").
		Eval blank location_exits to mean NO LOCATION CHANGE (use the current location's name) during the moving process.
-better text descriptions
-ability to save the updated "Locations" hash to the locations file, with proper syntax so it can be eval'd again next time.
-proper "quit" loops and breaks.
-add some way of telling WHERE you are in the creation process:
		-you're now creating the choice that will lead to your new location
		-you're now creating your location's description
		-you're now adding choices for your location
		-etc.
-the "location exit" for choices isn't set correctly-the "location exit" for choices isn't set correctly
