TODO:

-the "location exit" for choices isn't set correctly
-add some way of telling WHERE you are in the creation process:
		-you're now creating the choice that will lead to your new location
		-you're now creating your location's description
		-you're now adding choices for your location
		-etc.

-proper "quit" loops and breaks.
-better text descriptions
-ability to save the updated "Locations" hash to the locations file, with proper syntax so it can be eval'd again next time.



DONE
-location selection list (scan file)
-the "type 'self' to refer to your location' thing won't work anymore -- delete?"
